        <h3>MONKEY</h3>
   Monkeys are intelligent, social primates found in a variety of habitats across the globe, from tropical rainforests to mountainous regions. They are divided into two broad groups: New World monkeys (from Central and South America) and Old World monkeys (from Africa and Asia). While New World monkeys typically have prehensile tails that assist with climbing, Old World monkeys usually lack this feature but are known for their advanced cognitive skills and complex social structures.

Monkeys display a wide range of behaviors, from grooming and playing to tool use and vocal communication. Some well-known species include the capuchin, howler, macaque, and vervet monkey. These animals are omnivorous, eating a varied diet that can include fruits, seeds, leaves, insects, and small animals.

Monkeys are a favorite among visitors due to their expressive faces, active personalities, and engaging antics, making them a highlight of any zoo or wildlife experience.

WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?
You will find the monkey troop at MN04, near the tropical aviary.
