        <h3>LION</h3>
  The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the most recognizable and iconic big cats in the world. Known as the "king of the jungle" (despite living mostly in grasslands and savannas), lions are native to sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population of Asiatic lions found in Indiaâ€™s Gir Forest.

Unlike most cats, lions are highly social and live in groups called prides, typically consisting of related females, their cubs, and a coalition of males. Male lions are known for their majestic manes, which vary in color and size and play a role in intimidation and attraction.

Lions are apex predators and mainly hunt large herbivores such as wildebeest, zebras, and buffalo. Females do the majority of the hunting, while males protect the pride's territory.

Though once widespread across Africa, Asia, and Europe, lions now occupy only a fraction of their historic range due to habitat loss, human conflict, and declining prey populations. Conservation programs are crucial to ensuring their survival.

WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?
You will find the lions at LN07, near the savanna overlook.
